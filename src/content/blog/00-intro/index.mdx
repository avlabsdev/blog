## Introduction üó£Ô∏è

Yes, of course, the infamous first post: a self-introduction.

### Professional Life

#### Hello, I'm Aaron

Hello! My name is Aaron and I am a front-end web applications developer and designer. I have been doing development for over 5 years and I have done web UI design for over 15 years before that.

<Callout>Fun Fact: I landed my first web design job in middle school</Callout>

#### Brief History

I started out designing for the web back in 2002. I used Adobe Photoshop and notepad for HTML/CSS coding. I was fortunate to have met an awesome person and, now, long-time developer at the very beginning of my career who would later inspire me to learn web development.

  My favorite language: [JavaScript
  ES6](https://262.ecma-international.org/6.0/)
</Callout>

#### Style

I pride myself on clean, minimalistic, yet beautiful designs. I'm all about performance and optimization, leveraging speed and usability for the best user experience possible. I welcome you to visit my dev portfolio website at [avlabs.dev](https://avlabs.dev).

  My favorite design tool: [Figma](https://figma.com)

#### Current Work & Studies

I am currently working on advancing my knowledge and skills with JavaScript ES6, React.js, and Next.js. I love working with JavaScript most, but I have used other languages such as PHP & Python. I've always worked with MySQL and various databases briefly. JavaScript is my main language, but I have a lot of experience in so many areas, languages, and stacks. Not to mention 15+ years of web UI design experience.

  My favorite JavaScript Library: [React.js](https://react.dev/)

I have also been learning full-stack application development as I continue to grow and broaden my dev tool belt. I look forward to building more projects with React Native and Expo.

  My favorite JavaScript Framework: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

Before I briefly tell you about me, personally, I wanted to welcome you to reach out to me about your next project or current project needs. I am available immediately for hire or for contract/freelance work. I would love to talk with you and tell you more about what I have to offer. Drop me an email at [hello@avlabs.dev](mailto:hello@avlabs.dev).

### Personal Life ü™™

#### Who Am I, Really?

Again, my name is Aaron. I am originally from Cleveland, OH, USA, born and raised.

<Callout>Fun Fact: I'm a twin ü•≥</Callout>

I have a dog named Angel and a cat named Emily. Animals and nature mean a lot to me. I look to nature for a lot of my logic in life.

I love natural instinct. Nature might deceive you at times, but it never lies. Animals in the wild have core responsibilities to worry about and no time for wasting energy on things that don't matter. They need to eat, sleep, procreate, defend themselves, and repeat. I'd rather live a life like that than the one I have to be a part of today where there's all this bullshit going on I couldn't care less about, a society swept by media, fake news, and the inability to have an opinion on anything without harsh backlash.

**Long-winded sigh...**

#### In My Free Time

In my free time you can find me developing my next app, reading, writing, listening to music, or hanging out with and taking care of my animals. I also love to volunteer my time to those in need wherever and whenever I can.

#### Thank You for reading

If you made it this far, I want to thank you for reading my first blog post. It means a lot. I want to, once more, welcome you to reach out to me if you'd like. My "door" is always open and my ears are always listening.

#### Future Posts You Can Expect

This was just a stereotypical introductory post so you all can become somewhat familiar with me and who I am, where I've been, and where I am going.

Future posts will largely be about web application design and development, design and dev resources, educational materials, upcoming projects, project updates, and more! I will also keep a personal touch to this blog and add in my own personal commentary when I feel necessary.

Very Respectfully,<br />
Aaron Varga
